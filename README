Lumenc - A Clojure framework for generating music.

Running: 

Open the 'lumenc' file and edit the CLOJURE variable to point to your copy of clojure.jar.  Then you can simply do

 ./lumenc your_source_file.clj

and the resultant .wav will be created in your current directory.

Notes:

This software should be considered pre-pre-alpha.  Although I'll try to keep commits such that the demos always work, the software is likely buggy and certainly the range of filters available right now leaves much to be desired.  Part of the reason I'm doing this is to learn about digital audio synthesis, so the framework provides a platform from which I can test concepts as I learn them.  

It should also be pointed out that the software is very slooooooow.  Often several times slower than real time for even the simplest of tracks.  This is for a few reasons.  The first is that Clojure itself boxes numbers between function calls, so the nature of the chained-closure setup here makes mathematical operations much slower than they might be in plain java, even when using unchecked math which is sometimes possible.  Secondly, many of the filters written herein are written with an emphasis on readability rather than speed.  My goals for this project include putting readability and 'tweakability' of the filters as the first priority, making it easy to use and extend the available filters.  Because the system is not required to run in real time, speed will always take second place to this.  I do hope to optimise whenever possible though.

How to Use:

Please see the 'ex' folder for demos, and the quicktut.txt file for a usage tutorial.  And of course look at the source code.
